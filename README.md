# Study



## Overview
Study aims to revolutionize education by providing a space where students can find the help they need and contribute to the platform's growth through a model that rewards active participants.
The platform operates on an internal credit system that rewards users for uploading notes or leaving reviews.

### Key Principles
- **Ethics:** No monetary transactions for services except for book exchanges, which occur outside the platform.
- **Community:** Users contribute to the platform's growth by earning credits through actions like sharing notes or tutoring.
- **Recognition:** Active contributors are featured in a ranking system on the homepage.
